## **Wisconsin Men’s Gymnastics Alliance Mission Statement Vision**
Purpose Approved: Sunday September 5th, 2021

# **Mission Statement**

Opportunities for boys to continue gymnastics at the collegiate level are dwindling across the US. Many large universities with strong academic programs like the University of Wisconsin do not have opportunities for boys to do collegiate gymnastics.  The University of Wisconsin Madison men’s gymnastics team was cut in the early 1990s.  To fill the void a student org was formed in 2002 and became a recognized sport club by the university in 20xx.  The Wisconsin Men’s Gymnastics Alliance will build on the work of the sport club and other groups around Wisconsin to bring competitive men's collegiate gymnastics back to Wisconsin.  Our aim is to  provide more boys with the opportunity to continue their gymnastics careers in college and write a new chapter in the history of Wisconsin gymnastics.
